# 3. Battery/Electrolyser degradation

Date: 2024-12-03

## Status

TBJ

## Context

The `battery_degradation` function in `agents/battery.py` which linearly degrades a battery to 60% performance based on the total lifetime should be justified.
Just a year; barely any degradation. Also shortly justify electrolyser here.

## Decision

The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
