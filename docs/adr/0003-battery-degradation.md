# 3. Battery degradation

Date: 2024-12-03

## Status

TBJ

## Context

The `battery_degradation` function in `handlers/battery.py` which linearly degrades a battery to 60% performance based on the total lifetime should be justified.

## Decision

Again, we use the specifications of a state-of-the-art...

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
