# 7. Wind curtailment

Date: 2025-01-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Curtailing energy production sources is a method used to balance supply and demand on the electrical grid. This involves reducing the output of wind turbines (or solar) to prevent overloading the grid when supply exceeds demand. There might be slight differences for Solar and Wind.

## Decision

With the expertise of Repowered, we assume that Wind and Solar curtail according to the same rules, with the same reaction times. This is in Simon, so there is not really a decision here.

## Consequences

This prevents detailed investigation into PV and Wind turbines installation for subtle differences that do not have a big effect on the simulation.
